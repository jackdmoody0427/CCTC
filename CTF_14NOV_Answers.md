- 78

Regular Expressions3
File: home/garviel/numbers
Use regular expressions to match valid IP addresses. The flag is the number of addresses.
HINT: What are the valid numerical values of each octet in an IP address?

- `grep -Ewo "(([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\.){3}([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])" numbers |wc -l`
- 18

Regular Expressions4
File: home/garviel/numbers
Use regular expressions to match patterns that look similar to a MAC Address.
HINT: This is a loose match! Some of these results won't be true MAC addresses.
Flag format: ####

- `cat numbers | grep -P '^(?:(?:[A-Z]|\d){2}-){5}(?:[A-Z]|\d){2}$' | wc -l`
- 4877

- 178

Bash Logic2
The flag resides in $HOME/paths... you just need to determine which flag it is. It sits next to a string matching the name of a $PATH binary on your system.
Hint: The correct binary is not echo

```import subprocess
# set of all possible flags
with open('/home/garviel/paths') as fp:
  lines = fp.readlines()
  for l in lines:
    flag = l.split()[0]
    cmds = subprocess.run(['whereis', flag], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.decode().split(':')[1]
    if cmds != '\n':
      print(l)
```
