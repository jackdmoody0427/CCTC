## Day 6: Network Analysis

### **Fingerprinting and Host Identification**
- Variances in the RFC implementation for different OSâ€™s and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting

- Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)

- **POF (Passive OS Fingerprinting)**
    
    - Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options

    - Configuration stored in: `/etc/p0f/p0f.fp`
