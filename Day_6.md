## Day 6: Network Analysis

### **Fingerprinting and Host Identification**
- Variances in the RFC implementation for different OSâ€™s and systems enables the capability for fingerprinting

- Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)

- **POF (Passive OS Fingerprinting)**
    
    - Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options

    - Configuration stored in: `/etc/p0f/p0f.fp`

### **Network Traffic Sniffing**

- What makes traffic capture possible?
    - Libpcap
    - WinPcap (oudated)
    - NPCAP

- **Network Traffic Baselining**
    - Snapshots of whta the network looks like during a time frame
    - No industry standard
    - 7 days to establish the intitial snapshot
    - Prerequisite Information 
    - **Network Baseline Objective**
        
        - Determines the current state of your network
        - Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
        - Idenifying normal vs peak network traffic time frames
        - Verify port/ protocol usage

CTFs
***
1. How many total packets were captured in the pcap
    - 1908895
2. Determine all IP addresses that were captured in the pcap, and list them all in order. You should find 10

3. How many hosts are in teh capture? 
    - 8 (look at IP classes)

4. OSI

    What Transport Layer protocol is the most prominent in the capture?

    - Protocol Hierarchy Stats -> TCP --> Line-based test data 

5. OS Type
    p0f has extensive finger printing capabilities (as indicated by the name).

    Use p0f to read the pcap and determine the OS type of the host: 192.168.10.101
6. Cellular 

    There is traffic related to 2G & 3G Cellular Communications, which uses a packet oriented mobile data standard.
    
    What protocol is performing this communication?
    be sure to name the protocol and not the standard being used!

    - GPRS -> GSM 
7. Address 1 

    The protocol being used to generate the traffic associated with 239.x.x.x is a UDP based protocol which is commonly used with UPnP for finding devices and services on the network.

    What is this protocol?

8. Address 2 

    The protocol being used to generate the traffic associated with 239.x.x.x is a UDP based protocol which is commonly used with UPnP for finding devices and services on the network.

    What is this protocol?
    - SSDP 

9. Address 3 - source

    What is the mac address of the device that is sending the multicast SSDP traffic?

    - 00:50:56:c0:00:08

10. User Agent 4

    what user agent is making use of the protocol you discovered in Attack Analysis - addres 2 - protocol? 
    - Filter on SSDP
    - click on a capture
    - open the SSDP
    - see the 'user agent' is `Google Chrome`

11. DNS 1

    What is the IP address for the DNS server in the packet capture? 
    - filter DNS
    - look for the query to a website
    - see the destination and source ip that matches

12. DNS 2
    What IP Address and Port is the query responding to?

    Example:
    XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:PORT
    - open up a packet instance
    - look at the IP field
    - 192.168.10.111:54966

    Example (No Spaces):
    keurig.domain,1.1.1.1
    - filter the ip with `ap.addr == 224.0.0.251`
    - click the response entry
    - look for the type A record

    Determine the IP addresses for the top two talkers in the capture (the two hosts that generated the most traffic). (list in order e.g. 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2)

    - 192.168.10.101,192.168.10.111

20. 

21. Attacked Port

    Filter traffic communication between the IP addresses of the hosts determined in challenge 19, a UDP flood is occurring. What port is being attacked?

    - filter the ip
    - 55

22. 

23. Type of Attack

    What type of attack is the UDP flood discovered in challenge 22?

    - DoS

24. Type of Attack 2

    Is this an automated attack? (yes/no)

    Once you have completed challenge questions 1 - 24 you can shorten the pcap to make Wireshark run faster.

    First run this filter to select everything but the flooding of UDP port 55.

    !(udp.port==55)

    Next export the selected packets as a new pcap using File > Export Specified Packets.

    Save as a new pcap and load it in Wireshark. You should now only have 86345 packets instead of the 1.9 million you had before.

    - yes 

25.

    - `ip.dst == 192.168.10.111 && http.request.method == "POST"` 
    - wordpress

27. 

28. 

29. Plugin

    Consider the user agent strings identified in challenge 27.

    Analyze the related traffic, and identify what Plugin the vulnerability scan triggered on?
